## 📌 What is SQL?
SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to communicate with relational databases. It helps in creating, modifying, managing, and retrieving data efficiently.

---

## ❓ Why Do We Need to Use SQL?
- Manage and organize data
- Insert, update, delete, and query data
- Perform data analysis
- Handle access control and security

---

## 🧩 Components of a SQL System
- **SQL Engine** – Executes SQL queries
- **Query Processor** – Parses and optimizes queries
- **Transaction Manager** – Manages transactions (ACID)
- **Storage Engine** – Manages physical data storage

---

## ⭐ Characteristics of SQL
- Easy to learn and read
- Based on standard syntax (ANSI)
- Non-procedural (focuses on *what*, not *how*)
- Scalable and secure
- Works with many RDBMS tools (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.)

---

## ⚙️ How SQL Works
1. Query is written (e.g., `SELECT * FROM table`)
2. SQL engine parses and validates it
3. Query is optimized
4. Result is returned from the database

---

## 📏 Rules for Writing SQL Queries
- Use **uppercase** for SQL keywords
- End statements with a **semicolon (;)**
- Use **single quotes** for text values
- Avoid using reserved keywords for table/column names
- Keep naming conventions meaningful and consistent

---

## 🛠️ Types of SQL Commands
| Type | Commands |
|------|----------|
| DDL  | CREATE, ALTER, DROP |
| DML  | INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE |
| DQL  | SELECT |
| TCL  | COMMIT, ROLLBACK |
| DCL  | GRANT, REVOKE |

## ✅ Benefits of SQL
- Efficient data management
- Standardized across platforms
- High security and scalability
- Easily integrates with applications

---

## ⚠️ Limitations of SQL
- Not designed for non-relational data (e.g., images, documents)
- Complex queries may reduce readability
- SQL syntax may differ slightly between databases
- Limited programming logic compared to full languages

---

## 💼 SQL Use Cases
- Web and mobile apps (user data, login, content)
- Financial systems (transactions, accounts)
- E-commerce (products, inventory, orders)
- Healthcare (patient records, appointments)
- Business intelligence and reporting
