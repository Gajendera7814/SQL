##  What are SQL Operators?

SQL operators are **symbols or keywords** used in SQL statements to **perform operations** on data, such as comparisons, calculations, logic checks, or filtering.

They are commonly used in:

| `-` | Subtraction | `SELECT 10 - 5;` |
| `*` | Multiplication | `SELECT 10 * 5;` |
| `/` | Division | `SELECT 10 / 5;` |
| `%` | Modulus (remainder) | `SELECT 10 % 3;` |

### 2. üîç **Comparison Operators**
Used to compare two values.

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `=` | Equal to | `WHERE age = 25` |
| `!=` or `<>` | Not equal to | `WHERE name <> 'John'` |
| `>` | Greater than | `WHERE salary > 50000` |
| `<` | Less than | `WHERE marks < 40` |
| `>=` | Greater than or equal to | `WHERE age >= 18` |

### 3. üß† **Logical Operators**

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `BETWEEN` | Checks value in a range | `WHERE age BETWEEN 18 AND 30` |
| `IN` | Matches any value in a list | `WHERE country IN ('India', 'USA')` |
| `LIKE` | Pattern matching (wildcards) | `WHERE name LIKE 'A%'` |
| `IS NULL` | Checks for NULL values | `WHERE phone IS NULL` |

SELECT name, age, city
FROM users
WHERE age BETWEEN 20 AND 30
  AND city IN ('Delhi', 'Mumbai')
  AND is_active = TRUE;
