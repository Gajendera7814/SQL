# SQL NOT NULL Constraint

In SQL, constraints are used to enforce rules on data, ensuring the **accuracy, consistency, and integrity** of the data stored in a database. One of the most commonly used constraints is the `NOT NULL` constraint, which ensures that a column cannot have `NULL` values.

---

## üìò What is the SQL NOT NULL Constraint?

The `NOT NULL` constraint is used to enforce that a **column in a table must always contain a value**; it cannot contain a `NULL` value. By default, columns in SQL can hold `NULL` values, meaning they can have no data. However, for certain columns‚Äîsuch as IDs, names, or any required fields‚Äîyou may want to enforce the rule that no `NULL` values can be inserted.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This constraint is similar to a primary key constraint in that both prevent `NULL` values. However, they are different in their purpose and application:
>
> - A **Primary Key** uniquely identifies each record in a table.
> - A **NOT NULL** constraint simply ensures that a column cannot have empty or undefined values.

---

## üß© Key Points

- `NOT NULL` is used to enforce **mandatory fields**.
- It **prevents NULL values** from being inserted or updated.
- It is applicable at the **column level**.
- It can be used during **table creation** or **modification** (with the `ALTER` command).

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Syntax

### ‚úÖ CREATE TABLE Syntax:
```sql
CREATE TABLE table_Name (
    column1 data_type(size) NOT NULL,
    column2 data_type(size) NOT NULL,
    ...
);
````

## üèóÔ∏è SQL NOT NULL on CREATE a Table

In SQL, we can add `NOT NULL` constraints while **creating a table**.

### Example:

In the below example, the `EmpID` column will **not accept NULL values** when the `Emp` table is created because `NOT NULL` constraints are applied.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Emp (
    EmpID INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(50),
    Country VARCHAR(50),
    Age INT(2),
    Salary INT(10)
);
```

### Output:

A table named `Emp` is created with `EmpID` marked as `NOT NULL` and also as the primary key.

---

## üîÅ SQL NOT NULL on ALTER Table

We can also add a `NOT NULL` constraint to an **existing table** using the `ALTER` statement.

### Example:

If the `Emp` table has already been created, we can add a `NOT NULL` constraint to the `Name` column using the following SQL query:

```sql
ALTER TABLE Emp MODIFY Name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL;
```

This command ensures that the `Name` column will **no longer accept NULL values**, enforcing a requirement for all employee records to have a valid name.

---

## ‚úÖ Advantages of Using the NOT NULL Constraint

1. **Prevents Data Gaps:**
   With `NOT NULL`, you avoid incomplete or missing data, which is crucial for accurate data analysis.

2. **Enforces Business Logic:**
   Often, business rules require certain fields to be mandatory.
   *Example: An employee record must have an employee ID, name, and department.*

3. **Improves Data Integrity:**
   By preventing `NULL` entries, you ensure that critical data is always present, improving overall **database reliability**.

---

## üßæ Conclusion

The SQL `NOT NULL` constraint is a **powerful tool** that ensures the **integrity and completeness** of your database by **preventing NULL values** in critical columns.

Whether you‚Äôre creating a **new table** or modifying an **existing one**, applying the `NOT NULL` constraint guarantees that important data is always present. This is essential for **accurate reporting, analysis, and consistency** across your database.

‚úÖ **Tip:** Always consider which fields are required before inserting records into your tables to enforce data integrity with the `NOT NULL` constraint.
